Write a program that exports a compiled smart contract that has a method "hello".

You can use a generator to give you a starter template (you can name it whatever you like)

  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND generate sol YOUR_PROGRAM.js`
  or `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND g sol YOUR_PROGRAM.js`
  to generate a starter template for solidity code.

Modify that code, so that the smart contract:

  * has a method "hello" that returns a string

and then:

  Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify YOUR_PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
